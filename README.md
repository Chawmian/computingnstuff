They came, like most unlikely things, at night.
 
A shadowy figure emerged from the shadows, moving silently but swiftly. His cloak did not make a sound as he jumped up onto a balcony and climbed onto the roof, like most cloaks ought to, and his rucksack bounced silently off his side as he hurried down the lane of rooftops. His hat, a large-rimmed one, did not fly off his head when he jumped from one rooftop to another. Peculiar as he was, no one saw him move.

He was looking for something, his head sweeping from one end of the once-busy street to another, in that strange way that suggested inquisitiveness. He slowed his pace, and then finally stopped. Perhaps he had missed something, walked too fast to notice, or… wait.

It was just like how the prophecy had described it, a small balcony with red railings and herbs in pots hanging from the ceiling. He saw a man with an unshaven face, clearly fast asleep from the loud snores that emanated from his heaving chest. In one hand he held a shotgun, and the other a mug of Old Klamborg's rum. Not exactly a great duo at the best of times, the intruder thought privately. He hopped on the roof above the balcony silently. 

Snore

He swung himself onto the railing, careful not to touch any pots.

Snore

It was extremely obvious that the man was out cold. The cup was half empty, and he knew even a mouthful of that stuff could knock you out cold for half a day. So why was he so scared?

Snore

No, not scared. People like him didn’t get scared, it was literally impossible. Nervous would be a better word. He brushed aside the hanging pots slowly, even though he knew it wasn’t necessary to be quiet.

Grunt

The man froze midstep, his heart racing.

Snore

The man hesitated, then resumed his movements. Probably just a one-time fluke. Hopping down onto the tiled floor, he quietly slipped past the drunk guard and entered the building. He wasn’t that tall, but this house seemed to think otherwise, as he smacked his forehead right into the archway.

The house was clearly built with a small budget and no comfort. The walls were painted a non-descriptive white, and all the furniture were either old and rusting or crudely constructed. He stepped over a coffee table that had been used for a dining table, with plates of styvkoy on it. The shadow man vaguely remembered liking these tiny sausages, at least until he got food poisoning from one. The other gods had never quite let that incident live down. Now that they weren’t here yet, he popped one of the brightly coloured snacks into his mouth and chewed. Say what you will about the decor, but that drunkard made an hell of a styvkoy.

He now spotted a blue door, leading into a room separate from the living room. Slowly opening it, he gasped. Here was the thing that had drawn him here today, as well as many others coming soon.

A crate, a paintless one with splinters everywhere, sat right in the middle of the room, put on a chair with a large chunk taken out of one of its legs. Approaching it slowly, he leaned over the side of the wooden box and saw a baby, around five months old. Tufts of black hair sprouted up on her tiny head, and her eyes were closed in deep slumber. Gripping the makeshift crib tightly now, he poked her in the cheeks. Once, twice…

“She won’t wake.” Whirling around, he saw another man, dressed in a long, brown coat. His entire attire was strangely neat, his clean shaven face and dark eyes seems to suggest orderliness and calm. He did not smile when the man in black jumped back in surprise. His voice was deep but neat, like a judge, or a businessman.

“Malpoir. How about a warning next time? You almost scared me out of my skin...” The shadowy man relaxed. He knew this strange man would be coming, but still… 

“Hello, Ragmir. You’re the second one here today, and certainly not the last. Sit down.” He motioned to a workbench nearby.

“Know who else is coming today?”

“Meridian would definitely come, she wouldn’t miss a chance like this for the world, and wherever she goes, Apricant will certainly follow,” Malpoir stopped and reached into his coat pocket.  After rummaging for a while, he withdrew a bottle of unmarked whisky and three cups.

“You charmed the girl?”

“It seemed the best way to get started. Want some?” He had already filled the cups with alcohol and held out a cup for the man he called Ragmir.

“Three cups? Last time I checked, there were only two of us.”

“Check again.” Another voice chirped nearby, and for the second time today, he was startled. This voice wasn’t Malpoir’s, who was now looking around the room with interest . No, this voice was much higher, and cheerful, as if whoever the voice belonged to had just heard a particularly funny joke.

“Still can’t see me?” The voice had an echoing quality to it, making it difficult to pinpoint exactly where it came from. Suddenly, seemingly straight from the wall, a man emerged. His face was entirely obscured by a strange mask, with half of its face smiling and the other one crying. 

“Quentin. How long have you been here?” Ragmir handed him a glass.

“Long enough to see Mal here pick his nose, how many times was it, seven?” He dodged a punch to the face, but still got kicked in the shin.

Soon, the room began to fill with people. Each god‘s arrival was always unique, from opening a portal in the room or under an invisible cloak. They were all different from one another, from their races to their clothes. Despite this, they all seemed to know each other, cordial greetings flew from person to person, and soon, it was time to do what they had come to do.

They gathered around the child, who was now wide awake (Malpoir has removed the charm) and staring up at the gathered crowd with a sleepy interest. Several of the women (and men) had pinched her cheeks affectionately so many times that her face was red and raw.

“Who wants to start first?” Ragmir asked the crowd. No one answered 

Looks like everyone wants to see what everyone got for her first. Ragmir sighed. It was so typical of them, why couldn’t they just focus on helping the girl, instead of impressing everyone else?

The crowd had opened up a small empty circle surrounding the crate, and so he walked in, next to the girl. The room was completely silent now, not even a breath could be heard.

Ragmir leaned close, and whispered:

“I give you the gift of curiosity.”

The baby smiled. She liked the way his accent sounded.

The others each proceeded to bless the girl, from giving her useless ones, like beauty (how would that help her, would she smile at the beast until it got a heart attack?) to mildly useful ones, like courage. Finally, they put the amulet, the one that Malpoir had acquired through his various connections, around her neck, a sign of their blessing the child and also protection until she was old enough to fend for herself.

With the deed they had come to do finished, the gods vanished back into the night, saying goodbye to the little one for the last time.

Ragmir was the last to leave. In the short time that he had met the girl, he had grown rather fond of her. She stared up at him curiously as he leaned down, and said one last thing.

“Your destiny awaits, Robin.”

And with that, he vanished back into the night, like the most unlikeliest of things.
